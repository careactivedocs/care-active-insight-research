### GPS Feature

GPS tracking feature is assigned by property. Only the Care Active administrator can enable the GPS feature. Once the GPS feature is enabled, the data collection of any family account under the same property will have the GPS tracking feature. The participants are required to install the Care Active app on their mobile devices with WiFi, Bluetooth, Location Service permissions granted. The GPS data will be collected and sent to the Care Active cloud.

## Names

There are names for stations, devices, and families. User can change the name through the app. Care Active Insight also show the names of stations, devices, and families but these names are the alias. Initially, the alias names are the same as the names on the app. The manager can change the alias names that will not affect the names on the app that may be used by the participants. All the generated reports are based on the alias names. The maintenance reports and the device name change logs shows both the alias names and the names on the app.

## Moving Family Account

The old data will not be deleted, but it will not be visible in the new property. The manager of the old property can still see/download/generate charts of the old data. The manager of the new property can only see/download/generate charts of the new data. If you need to move the old data to the new property, please contact Care Active support.
